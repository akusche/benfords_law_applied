A website where home or business users can offer their car to potential buyers. In short, **some people offer a car, others buy**.\n",

    "The following diagram shows the flow of data. First, a Python crawl.py program visits the auto website, downloads the entire page, and looks for the relevant attributes. The price of a car is a reasonable attribute to conduct a Benford law analysis on. The result of the crawler program is a list of around XXX vehicles (depending on the crawler settings). This list is fed to Excel and the occurrence of every first digit is counted."

The trend that higher digits appears less often can be observed, but digits as 1,6,7,8,9 are rather less often in the sample dataset as Benford's law would suggest.
